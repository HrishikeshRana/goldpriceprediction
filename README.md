# Gold_price_predictior
Machine learning (ML) can be leveraged to analyze historical and real-time data, helping to predict and understand the complex patterns that influence gold prices. 


# Disclaimer:

This machine learning project has been developed as a side endeavor due to the unexpected cancellation of my trading competition. It is important to note that this initiative is a personal exploration and not a formalized research project. The predictive models and analyses presented herein are the outcome of individual curiosity and interest in the intersection of machine learning and financial markets.
